3. Save the File:

markdown
Copy code
- Save the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file in your repository.
4. Using the Template:

vbnet
Copy code
- The next time someone creates a PR in your repository, they'll see this template automatically filled out in the PR description. They can then complete the template with the relevant details.
You can make your template as simple or as detailed as your project requires. It's a good practice to include sections like "Summary," "Issue," "Changes," "Checklist," and "Related PRs" to provide comprehensive information to reviewers. Contributors will appreciate having clear guidelines for what should be included in a PR.

Additionally, if you're using GitHub, you can define different templates for different types of PRs by creating files like feature_request.md or bug_report.md with specific content for each type.

Remember that PR templates are not limited to GitHub. Other Git hosting platforms or self-hosted Git solutions may also support PR templates with similar or different conventions.

Once you've created the PR template, it's a good idea to make sure your contributors are aware of it and encourage them to use it when submitting PRs.
